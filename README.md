## üß† Summary

This repository includes a full **proof-of-concept (PoC)** that demonstrates how adversaries can abuse **Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM)** for stealthy **lateral movement** across Windows environments. The DCOM payload functions similarly to an SMB payload.

The code was demonstrated during my session at **Black Hat MEA 2023**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Components

### ‚úÖ COM Server (Out-of-Proc EXE)

- Hosts a COM interface exposed via DCOM on port `135`.
- Accepts requests from remote clients to execute commands (e.g., `systeminfo`).
- Writes output to disk (`C:\Windows\Temp\logs.txt`).

### ‚úÖ COM Client

- Connects to a remote machine using DCOM.
- Authenticates using provided credentials.
- Calls `COMSend(...)` to request tasks and send results.

---

## üöÄ Usage

### Server Side (on Target Machine)

1. Register the COM server using `regsvr32` or by embedding registration logic (`SetupRegistryKeys()`).
2. Make sure port **135** is accessible.
3. Place `COMServer.exe` in an accessible location.

### Client Side (Attacker System)

```bash
COMClient.exe <TargetIP> <Username> <Password> <Domain>
```

The client will:

- Connect to the remote DCOM server.
- Ask for a command (default: `systeminfo`).
- Execute the command.
- Send the result back.
